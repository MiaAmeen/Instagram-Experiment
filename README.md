# Instagram-Experiment
 Creating likebots and analyzing feed to determine the extent to which social media facilitates political polarization.
 
A) CREATING AND USING THE BOTS
   1. Create 3 Instagram 'like bots' from various demographics
  - like bot 1 follows democratic candidate Joe Biden
  - like bot 2 follows republican candidate Donald Trump
  - like bot 3 follows both democratic and republican candidates 
  
   2. Follow all follower suggestions given by Instagram
 
   3. Like bots will like every post that the Instagram algorithm feeds it, for a specified time during a specified hour, and follow all suggested profiles daily.
 - After 1 week, the bots will have amassed a list of chronological posts that is fed to it by the algorithm. 
 - The posts are predicted to become more and more politically polarized as the bot spends time on the app
 
 B) ANALYZING DATA
  1. Feeds of all 3 bots will be parsed and scraped for the following: post captions, mentions, and comments
  2. This data will be scraped for political 'key words'
  3. The frequency of use of certain key words will be analyzed over the 1 week time period
  
 C) PRESENTATION
   1. create a graphic bubble graph that presents the use of key words over time
